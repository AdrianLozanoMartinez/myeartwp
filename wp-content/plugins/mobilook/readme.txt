Instant mobile view of website (pages, posts, products) for responsive web design on phone (+ dualscreen). This plugin also offers helpful tools on each page, such as LinkedIn Post Inspector, and Google Mobile-Friendly Test Tool.

== Description ==

In an era where mobile usage dominates internet traffic, it's crucial to have a mobile-friendly website. Ensuring your website meets mobile-friendly criteria is a key factor in determining your online success, both for users and search engines.

Here's what you should know:

- Mobile web traffic is growing by 30% annually, with most of this growth occurring in developing countries ([Hootsuite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mobilook/Hootsuite)).
- Over half of all searches are now conducted via mobile, and this number continues to rise ([Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/report-nearly-60-percent-searches-now-mobile-devices-255025)).
- 57.3% of all internet traffic comes from mobile devices/tablets, with 42.7% coming from desktops ([Stat Counter](http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet)).
- The number of U.S. users who only use desktops is decreasing, falling from 25 million in 2015 to 18 million in 2017. It's projected to drop to 11 million by 2021 ([Wiredseo](https://www.wiredseo.com/mobile-marketing-statistics-2017/)).
- Conversely, the number of mobile internet users has increased by 28% over the last two years, reaching 41 million in the United States in 2017 ([eMarketer](https://www.emarketer.com/articles/)).

The MOBILOOK (Mobile View) plugin, an extension of Google DEVTOOL, allows you to instantly check the visual responsive design of your pages, articles, or products on mobile, in various formats (Apple, Samsung, Google devices) (including foldable screen phones like the Samsung Galaxy Fold with the PRO version).

Once installed, MOBILOOK (Mobile View) is deployed on each of your pages. A section appears just below the WordPress Content Editor; once your content is published, it immediately shows you the mobile rendering based on the format you've defined.

There's no longer a need to check what your site looks like on your mobile to see if it's well suited to phones, tablets, and other media (responsive).

**PRO FEATURES**

**MOBILOOK PRO (Mobile View) offers several features:**

- Activation of the plugin for your WooCommerce-generated pages, for your online shop so you can instantly see if the product page design is responsive.
- Activation of additional formats – The PRO version gives you access to a large list of mobile/tablet formats (15), even for foldable screen phones (DualScreen).
- Activation of three very useful features:
- LinkedIn Post Inspector allows your pages to be crawled by LinkedIn's bots to generate up-to-date OpenGraphs.
- Google Mobile-Friendly Test Tool allows your page to be analyzed by Google to identify if it meets all the criteria of effectiveness.
- Mobile SEO (zoom website on mobile) – This feature adds an optimized viewport meta tag on all your pages allowing users zooming permission with mobile browsers.

When you're involved in internet marketing on a daily basis, you need to learn little tricks to speed things up.

**What is LinkedIn Post Inspector?** Have you ever shared your website link on LinkedIn and noticed an incorrect link preview title, description, or image? That's normal! Essentially, when you share a link from WordPress, LinkedIn bots fetch the images and other content information. LinkedIn typically scrapes every URL that users and pages share and displays the featured image, title, and description.

However, when you create a fresh new page and post it directly to LinkedIn (or change the content of an existing page), LinkedIn isn't always able to display your metadata (image preview, title, and description) and the rendering isn't ideal (often, the "featured image" doesn't appear). Once your content is published, the features available on each of your pages allow your URL to be crawled by LinkedIn Post Inspector to generate up-to-date OpenGraphs so that it looks perfect on social media.

**What is Google Mobile-Friendly Test Tool?** This tool, compared to Google DEVTOOL, actually tells you how Googlebot (Google spider) sees your page, rather than how your mobile users might see it. That itself is very helpful because you can use the feedback for SEO purposes as well. If your website passes the test, then you will see a green message that says "Awesome! **This page is mobile-friendly**." If it does not pass, then the message will be red and say " **Not mobile-friendly**."

In the event that your website does not pass the mobile test, it will also provide the reasons for which it failed, such as the content being wider than the screen or links being too close together. This is THE TOOL that shows you whether Google considers your page to be mobile friendly. This feature (available on each of your pages) allows your URL to be analyzed by Google once your content is published.

**What is a responsive site?**

Responsive web design is the practice of building websites that suitably work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused on providing intuitive and gratifying experiences to everyone.

In recent years, Google has been increasingly pushing to ensure that all websites are mobile friendly. This makes sense because mobile searches have consistently been on the rise since 2009 and finally surpassed desktop searches in 2018 (in 2018, [52.2% of global web traffic](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241462/global-mobile-phone-website-traffic-share/) came from cellphones).

**Why is it important for SEO?**

Since April 2015, Google officially started rewarding mobile-friendly websites and penalizing sites that were not mobile-friendly in its the search rankings. A study by [Blue Corona](https://www.bluecorona.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blue-Corona-Case-Study-Why-Go-Mobile-Friendly.pdf) revealed that websites that did not switch to mobile-friendly platforms before the update in 2015 were hit with a hefty 50%+ traffic reduction penalty. This penalty came because Google dropped their SEO rankings, which resulted in fewer people seeing and clicking these websites.

The same study revealed that in 2015, 70% of websites on the first page of Google were optimized for mobile device viewing. Among these 70% of first-page search results that were mobile friendly, conversion rates tended **to skyrocket after the switch**.
