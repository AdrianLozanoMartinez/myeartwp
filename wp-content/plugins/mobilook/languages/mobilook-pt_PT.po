"Responsive web design is the practice of building websites that suitably "
"work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, "
"mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused on providing intuitive "
"and gratifying experiences to everyone. In recent years, Google has been "
"increasingly pushing to ensure that all websites are mobile friendly. This "
"makes sense because mobile searches have consistently been on the rise since "
"2009 and finally surpassed desktop searches in 2018 (in 2018, 52.2% of "
"global web traffic came from cellphones)."

"Since April 2015, Google officially started rewarding mobile-friendly "

"switch to mobile-friendly platforms before the update in 2015 were hit with "
"a hefty 50%+ traffic reduction penalty. This penalty came because Google "
"dropped their SEO rankings, which resulted in fewer people seeing and "
